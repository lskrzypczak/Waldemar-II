# Waldemar-II

1. Construction
Original code revision for simple mobile robot. This robot uses two stepper motor for movement, third rear roll as support 
and two front-side IR sensors for obstacle detect.

2. Software
The operation algorithm is very simple. If it detects an obstacle, robot stops immediately. Then it moves backwards and last it
turns away from obstacle. This turn is made by random angle to avoid riding the same path.
